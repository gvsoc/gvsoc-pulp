/**
 * @brief FlooNoc network-on-chip
 *
 * This models the FlooNoc as a single components.
 * It has to be connected to initiators and targets which are accessible through memory-mapped
 * requests.
 * Internals routers and network interfaces are declared by the generator in the component
 * configuration and instantiated as internal blocks.
 * Here are the definition of few terms used in the model:
 * - Network interface: entry point where bursts from initiators are injected into the noc. It is
 *   in charge of determining the position of the destination based on the destination address, and
 *   splitting bursts into internal noc requests which fits the width of the noc.
 * - Routers: their role is to bring internal requests from one point to another. There should be
 *   one router at each node of the noc, so that requests can go anywhere.
 * - Targets: a target is a master IO interface which corresponds to final destinations for
 *   internal requests. Once the destination is reached by a router, the request is sent to the
 *   target by sending the request to the interface.
